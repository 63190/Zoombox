Zoombox
=============

Zoombox is an easy to use Javascript class that allow you to overlay images and videos on the current page.

Set up
-------

First, place the whole directory "Zoombox" at the root of your website :

* Zoombox uses 2 different Javascript scripts that you will have to import in this exact same order (in <head> or just before </body>)
	<script type="text/javascript" src="/zoombox/jquery.js">
	</script><script type="text/javascript" src="/zoombox/zoombox.js"></script>
* Link the CSS file to your page in the <head>
	<link href="/zoombox/zoombox.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" />

How it works ?
-------
* add rel="zoombox"onto your links in order to add the Zoombox effect
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oejjWGFs6o" title="Session 2006" rel="zoombox">Lien</a>
* if you would like a group of pictures, you will have to mention a group name in brackets
	<a href="images/image-1.jpg" rel="zoombox[vacances]">image 1</a>
	<a href="images/image-2.jpg" rel="zoombox[vacances]">image 2</a>
	<a href="images/image-3.jpg" rel="zoombox[vacances]">image 3</a>
* You can also mention a length and a height to the Box, rel="zoombox 800 600", in case of a link which is not a picture
